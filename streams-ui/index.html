        <p><strong>The recommendation:</strong> A player should not exceed a maximum of three days on the same stream. In the event of having multiple players on the same stream for the maximum duration, there will need to be an agreement between the players (coin toss) as to who will remain on the stream in question for an additional day in order to do the handover/knowledge transfer to keep the stream flowing, if the stream is still relevant. The are also some basic constrains implemented at a software level to increase flow and to reduce errors while making changes to the streams.
