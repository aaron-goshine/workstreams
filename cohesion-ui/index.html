        <p><strong>This graph represents:</strong> 
          what I would like to call the cohesive position of a team. 
          Data is collected based on the pairing events carried out by the team.
          The weighted connection between nodes represents the strength of bond between a pair.

                  </p>
 <p><strong>This recommendation is to:</strong> 
Avoid imbalances where unique pairs out weigh the overall cohesion of the team.
Hence where there are obvious weak links the team should rectify this by encouraging collaboration to strengthen those weak links
